MindNet

This project is a journaling site where you can write notes, reflect, and get help from a chatbot. I just named it “MindNet” – since it's a place to store your thoughts.
I made it because of the decrease in the practice of journaling and the increase in the use of websites.
I built it in VScode using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript to handle notes, filtering, a prompt wheel, and modals.
The hardest part was getting the note system to feel smooth and calm and making the prompt wheel spin. 
Along the way, I learned a lot about local storage, DOM manipulation, and subtle animations to make everything feel nice without being too distracting.
